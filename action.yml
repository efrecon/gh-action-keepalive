name: Keepalive Workflows
description: |
  Automatically generates activity on the default git branch when no activity
  has been recorded for a longer period of time. This avoids workflows to be
  disabled by GitHub after 60 days of inactivity. By default, this action uses a
  hidden file within the `.github` directory whenever git activity is required.
  The path to that file can be controlled through the `liveness` input.

inputs:
  timeout:
    description: |
      The number of seconds of inactivity on the default branch before
      generating a commit. The default is 41 days, i.e. just above 2/3 of the
      GitHub inactivity trigger.
    required: false
    default: "3542400"
  liveness:
    description: |
      Path (relative to repository) to a file where a marker will be
      put/actualised whenever activity is required to be generated on the
      repository. This file is used whenever the `marker` is empty, i.e. in most
      cases.
    default: '.github/.github_liveness.txt'
  token:
    description: |
      GitHub token. The default is the default github token, which is enough to
      perform a git commit onto the default file from `liveness`. If you want to
      use a workflow such as the activity marker instead, pass a token with
      enough privileges to change the content of workflows. In that case, you
      might want to use the current workflow, i.e. the workflow running the
      action available at `github.workflow`.

    required: false
    deprecationMessage: |
      This input is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use
      environment variables instead!
    default: ""
  marker:
    description: |
      Name of workflow to use for activity marker. The default is to have an
      empty marker, in which case this action will use the file from `liveness`
      when it is necessary to generate activity on the repository to keep it
      alive. Instead of an empty marker, you can pass the name of a workflow
      instead, e.g. the value of `github.workflow`, in which case the marker
      will be added/updated at the end of the workflow that called the action.
      This requires a GitHub token that is able to change workflows, which the
      default `github.token` cannot do.
